\section{Testing}

The test environment used to test MCDTPi used commodity servers rented from a cloud computing company called DigitalOcean. Two servers were rented, one deployed in New York, USA and the second deployed in Amsterdam, Netherlands---the distance was deliberate to test MCDTPi over WAN. The rented servers were configured with 4 CPUs, 8GB of RAM, 80GB SSD, and 5TB of transfer and run Ubuntu 16.04LTS. DigitalOcean does not disclose any server specifications beyond this. The servers were further configured with the cross-platform version of .NET Framework, .NET Core 1.0.3, in order to execute the tests for MCDTPi.
